Branch - Hello World Setup
There is a branch here for anyone interested in playing around with a bare bones apollo express graphql server.. I added some useful functionality
around directive resolvers for security, as well as some graphql-tools related schema organization functionality as that gets important quickly as
schema files and resolver files grow... i also added in the things to make your project run easier like nodemon(restarts you server on save), prettier/eslint
(for code quality), babel (javascript compiler, allowed me to use imports vs require statements) etc... nothing fancy but next branch will have some additional 
functionality
